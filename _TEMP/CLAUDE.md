   - Three-day view: Today, Tomorrow, Day After
   - Section-specific filtering and statistics

#### Technical Architecture:

**Components:**
- `DashboardComponent`: Main orchestrator with polling, filtering, and stats logic
- `ActivityCardComponent`: Linear layout with tooltip functionality
- `NotificationToggleComponent`: Real-time notification management

**Models & Interfaces:**
- `FilterState`: Type and status filter state
- `DayFilters`: Multi-day filter management
- `ProcessedEvent`: Enhanced event model with capacity and guest data
- `DayStats`: Statistics aggregation interface

**Services:**
- `CalendarService`: Google Calendar API integration with polling
- Real-time data updates every 30 seconds
- Error handling and loading states

#### Styling Updates:
- **Neumorphic Dark Theme**: Consistent with original design
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-optimized layouts
- **CSS Custom Properties**: Centralized color management
- **Smooth Animations**: Hover effects and transitions
- **Linear Card Design**: Horizontal layout with proper spacing

#### File Structure Updates:

## Key Technical Decisions

1. **Standalone Components**: Using Angular 18+ standalone component architecture
2. **Reactive Data Flow**: RxJS observables for real-time updates
3. **Filter State Management**: Component-level state with reactive updates
4. **Linear Layout**: Flexbox-based horizontal card design with mobile grid adaptations
5. **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript interfaces for all data models
6. **Theme Architecture**: CSS custom properties with class-based theme switching
7. **Mobile-First Design**: Progressive enhancement from mobile to desktop
8. **Component Communication**: Event emission for drawer and theme state management

## Performance Considerations

- **Polling Optimization**: 30-second intervals for calendar data
- **Change Detection**: OnPush strategy where applicable
- **Memory Management**: Proper subscription cleanup
- **Responsive Images**: Optimized asset loading
- **CSS Optimization**: SCSS compilation with tree-shaking
- **Bundle Size**: Optimized from ~210KB to ~203KB through component streamlining
- **Theme Transitions**: Smooth 0.3s animations without layout thrashing
- **Mobile Optimization**: Compressed layouts and font scaling for performance

## Browser Compatibility
- Modern browsers supporting ES2022+
- Progressive Web App features
- Service Worker integration for offline support
